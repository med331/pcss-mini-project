# pcss-mini-project
A mini project in Programming of Complex Software Systems @ Aalborg University. The purpose of this project was to implement an online blackjack game using c++. The player is able to open the client program, connect to the remote server, and receive game updates and send actions (whether to hit or stand with their current hand).
